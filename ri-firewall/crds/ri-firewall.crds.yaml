              FirewallInstanceSpec defines the desired state of FirewallInstance.
              K8s is a declarative API; the operator will reconcile the state on the
              cluster step-by-step until the actual state reaches the desired state
              specified here.
              The desired state of the FirewallInstance is a firewall deployment with the
              specified rule configuration.

                    FirewallInstanceCondition describes a single condition for the
                    FirewallInstance status.
                    This follows the common conventions for representing status in K8s.
