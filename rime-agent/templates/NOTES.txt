Your RI Platform Agent is starting!
To verify your agent is running properly, use `kubectl get pods` or check the Agents page in the UI.
If the pods have errored or the agent is not "Active" in the UI after several minutes,
check your configuration and contact a Robust Intelligence representative if needed.

{{- if .Values.supportBundle.enabled }}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Generate a support bundle for the rime-agent, run the following command:
    kubectl support-bundle --load-cluster-specs -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

Get the values of the collected data by running the following command:
    mkdir support-bundle-values && tar -xvf <NAME OF SUPPORT BUNDLE>.tgz -C support-bundle-values/

Inspect the configuration for the support-bundle either:
    1. view the in-cluster configmap named {{ include "rime-agent.supportBundleConfigMapName" . }}
    2. navigate to the public helm repository to see the non-templated version of the configmap: https://github.com/RobustIntelligence/helm/tree/<RIME_VERSION>/rime-agent

If you need to share the support bundle with Robust Intelligence, please follow the instructions found in the RI Knowledge Base
