Your RI Platform Agent is starting!
To verify your agent is running properly, use `kubectl get pods` or check the Agents page in the UI.
If the pods have errored or the agent is not "Active" in the UI after several minutes,
check your configuration and contact a Robust Intelligence representative if needed.
